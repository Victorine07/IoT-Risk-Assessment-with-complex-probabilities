### CORRECTNESS ANALYSIS: step-by-step reasoning

Algorithm 2: "OR" Misuse Impact (MI) Conditional Probability
    Input: Local Static MI_LS of attack sn : MI_LS(sn) = c; MI of Parent attacks of attack sn: MIpa
    Output: Conditional MI of sn resulting from an OR join-type of parent attacks MIpa 
    1. MI(sn) = MI_LS(sn)
    2. if MIpa is not empty:
    3.   UNION_spa = MIpa[0]
    4.   for i in (1, MIpa) do
    5.     INTERSECT_spa = UNION_spa * MIpa[i]
    6.     exclusion1 = UNION_spa − INTERSECT_spa
    7.     exclusion2 = MIpa[i] − INTERSECT_spa
    8.     UNION_spa = exclusion1 + INTERSECT_spa + exclusion2
    9.   end
   10. MI(sn) = MI(sn) * (MI(sn) + UNION_spa)
   11. return MI(sn )

CORRECTNESS DEFINITION:
    The algorithm should correctly compute the conditional impact of attack sn given that at least one of its parent attacks MIpa has 
    occurred, while also effectively managing the impact of cycles.

ALGORITHM 1: CORRECTNESS ANALYSIS
    INITIALIZATION (Lines 1-3):
        Line 1: MI(sn) = MI_LS(sn): correct initialization of the MI of sn with its local static impact. This sets the baseline for the node's impact.
        Line 3: UNION_spa = MIpa[0]: correct initialization of the UNION_spa with the impact of the first parent. This sets the initial combined impact.
        These set the initial values for the calculation of the cumulative parent impact.

    INCLUSION-EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE (Lines 4-9):
        The for loop iterates through the remaining parent impacts in MIpa and correctly implements the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the union of the parent impacts (MIpa).
          "UNION_spa" progressively stores the combined impact of the parent attacks of attack sn.
          "INTERSECT_spa" calculates the intersection of the current "UNION_spa" and the next parent impact.
          "exclusion1" and "exclusion2" calculate the exclusive parts of the impacts.
          "INTERSECT_spa", "exclusion1" and "exclusion2" accurately determine the non-overlapping portions of the impacts.
        This ensures that the combined impact of the parents is calculated correctly for an "OR" relationship, following the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    IMPACT COMPUTATION AND CYCLE HANDLING (Line 10):
        Line 10: MI(sn) = MI(sn) * (MI(sn) + UNION_spa): combines the node's local impact with the combined parent impact.
        Dynamic Behavior:
          When cycles occur, the MI(sn) values are recalculated with each cycle.
          The initialization of MI(sn)=MI_LS(sn) term acts as a dampening factor, preventing indefinite growth.
          The impact values converge to a stable state after a few cycles.
        Justification:
          The constant MI_LS(sn) acts as an anchor.
          The changing UNION_spa values drive the dynamic adjustment.
          The formula creates a feedback loop that leads to convergence.

    RETURN VALUE (Line 11):
        Line 11: return MI(sn): The algorithm returns the calculated conditional MI of sn.

    Edge Cases and Considerations:
        Empty MIpa: If MIpa is empty, Lines (2-10) are skipped, and the MI of sn remains MI_LS(sn), which is correct.
        Zero Values: If any impact value is zero, the calculations are handled correctly through the inclusion-exclusion principle.
        Real-World Context:
          The algorithm models the propagation of impact in an attack graph.
          The cycle-handling mechanism ensures that the impact values stabilize, reflecting the real-world behavior of attackers.



### COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:

    Loop Complexity (Lines 4-9):
        The loop iterates n - 1 times, where n is the number of parent impacts in MIpa.
        Inside the loop, all operations are constant-time arithmetic operations.
        Therefore, the complexity of the loop is O(n).

    Line 9 Complexity:
        Line 9 involves constant-time arithmetic operations, so its complexity is O(1).

    Graph Complexity:
        To compute the MI for all nodes in the graph, a graph traversal should be performed (O(V + E)).
        For each node, Algorithm 2 O(n) is executed, with 'n', the number of parents for that node.
        The sum of the number of parents for all nodes is equal to the number of edges (E).
        Therefore, the overall complexity of Algorithm 2 when applied to the entire graph is O(V + E).


### KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

    Cycle Handling:
        The formula in line 10 is a custom formula to compute the impact of an attack sn, given the parent attacks.
        The formula in line 10 is the core mechanism for handling cycles. It ensures that the impact doesn't grow indefinitely.
        This handling of cycles does not change the Big O runtime complexity, but it does change the resulting values.
